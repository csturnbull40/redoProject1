Project: Course Management System

Description:
This project implements a simple course management system using a linked list data structure. It allows users to add courses, delete courses, delete all courses, and display the list of courses. The courses are stored in a linked list in ascending order based on their course codes.

Input Data:
The user will input the course details including the course code, credit hours, and grade.

Output Result:
The program will display the list of courses before and after each deletion operation.

Procedures to Run the Program:
1. Compile the program files using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Enter details for ten courses as prompted.
4. The program will display the list of courses before and after deleting two courses.

Files Included:
1. main.cpp: Contains the main function to run the program.
2. CourseNode.hpp: Header file containing the definition of the CourseNode class.
3. CourseList.hpp: Header file containing the definition of the CourseList class.
4. CourseNode.cpp: Implementation file for the CourseNode class.
5. CourseList.cpp: Implementation file for the CourseList class.
6. README.txt: This file containing project information and instructions.
